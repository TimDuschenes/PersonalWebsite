:: About this website [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2750,2025","size":"100,100"}
Tactically, this website just directs you to my email address (did I mention it's timduschenes@gmail.com?) but emotionally, it also helps you get to know me a bit.

[[How did you make this site?]]


:: Actually, I need help figuring that out [speaker-Tim] {"position":"4000,1225","size":"100,100"}
That's totally fine, and I'd love to help you figure it out. Drop me an email at timduschenes@gmail.com

:: Are you also a New Yorker? [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2325,625","size":"100,100"}
Are you also a New Yorker?

[[Yes, I am!]]

[[No, I'm not]]


:: Branding [speaker-Tim] {"position":"4200,1225","size":"100,100"}
Honestly, I don't really do much 'pure' branding work. If you want to know how people think about your brand, and what your new strategic direction should be, I can help. But if you want a new logo or brand colours, let me put you in touch with a friend instead!

[[You spell 'colors' with a 'u'?]]
[[Oh yeah, I mean the brand strategy bit->Strategy]] 
[[Sure, put me in touch]]



:: Brooklyn [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2175,975","size":"100,100"}
Same! I'm in Park Slope.

<% story.showDelayed("How do you like living here?"); %>


:: Can I see your resume? [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2850,550","size":"100,100"}
Of course! Here's a <a href="Assets/221202_TimDuschenes_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>.

<% story.showDelayed("Was there a project"); %>


:: Data ethics [speaker-Tim] {"position":"3050,1775","size":"100,100"}
I helped a big consumer goods company understand the ethcial issues around their use of consumer data. Then I helped them identify the best safeguards for ensuring consumer trust, and helped them advocate successfully within the company.

[[Fine, but what do you actually MAKE?]] 
[[Can I see your resume?]] 


:: Design research or codesign [speaker-Tim] {"position":"3800,1225","size":"100,100"}
Sounds good. I've done a fair bit of 'traditional' human-centered design research, but I much prefer working in more deeply engaged ways that give communities more agency and access to resources. I'm always happy to write research plans and conduct/facilitate research interviews or workshops.

[[hrmm that doesn't sound quite right]]
[[That sounds right. I'll email you now!]]


:: Do you enjoy living here? [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2325,500","size":"100,100"}
I do! It definitely has up and downsides. At its best, New York is a beautiful collision. At its worst, it can be selfish and uncaring.

<% story.showDelayed("Are you also a New Yorker?"); %>


:: Do you make a lot of websites? [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2575,2300","size":"100,100"}
I've made a few! I'm a self-taught code-writer, but I'm good at picking up new technical skills, and especially new software. I love websites as an art form (check out my <a href="https://www.are.na/tim-duschenes/websites-1524154573" target="_blank">are.na channel</a>!). Recently I made a <a href="https://timduschenes.github.io/Peppers/" target="_blank">pepper database</a> for a local farmer.

[[What other personal things have you been working on recently?]]
[[You seem to like food a lot]] 



:: Don't worry [speaker-Tim] {"position":"4300,1550","size":"100,100"}
Don't worry, I promise I won't make your organization sound English. And to answer the unspoken questions: yes I'm also an American citizen, so no I don't need visa sponsorship.

[[Hah! Tell me more about other kinds of work you do->What kind of thing]] 


:: Fed gov [speaker-Tim] {"position":"3050,1400","size":"100,100"}

:: Have you done any work in food? [speaker-Tim] {"position":"1800,1000","size":"100,100"}
A little! I was a 2021-22 Forefront Fellow at the Urban Design Forum. I helped make some <a href="https://urbandesignforum.org/initiative/neighborhood-fare/new-markets-for-new-americans/" target="_blank">cool materials</a> for new immigrants into New York who want to start food businesses.

<% story.showDelayed("Was there a project"); %>


:: How did you get into this? [speaker-Tim] {"position":"3050,1975","size":"100,100"}
I did a degree in industrial design, but I was mostly interested in people and how they interact. I found early on that strategy and service design let me get more to the heart of the human side.

<% story.showDelayed("What I've done"); %>


:: How did you make this site? [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2575,2175","size":"100,100"}

I've been in NYC for about six years now. It really sneaks up on you...

[[Do you enjoy living here?]]

[[Have you done any work in food?]]


:: I just want to know a bit about you [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2325,225","size":"100,100"}
Sure! What do you want to know?

[[What kind of work do you do?]]
[[What are some things that make you happy?]]



:: I love it [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2175,1400","size":"100,100"}
Aw that's so nice to hear. I kind of get in the habit of talking down New York, but it's really such a beautiful place.

<% story.showDelayed("Is there anything else_1"); %>


:: I'm interested in hiring you [speaker-Tim] {"position":"3575,250","size":"100,100"}

:: Usually this means [speaker-Tim] {"position":"2750,1750","size":"100,100"}
Often the strategy work involves lots of communication and storytelling. It depends a lot what the client needs, but that could mean making presentations, websites, a book, or even facilitating a big event. Whatever is needed to help people tell the right story.
